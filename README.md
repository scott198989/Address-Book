# Address-Book App

# Introduction:

I am currently taking classes on Udemy to expand my knowledge on backend frameworks like Ruby on Rails.  This project stores a list of ten cities and their area codes.  The user can requst a city, and the area code will be provided.  If the user enters a city that is not in the "database", a error message will appear and the user can try again.
