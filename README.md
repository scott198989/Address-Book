## Introduction 🌐

I'm currently honing my backend skills through Udemy courses, focusing on Ruby and Ruby on Rails. This project serves as a practice tool that stores a list of ten cities along with their corresponding area codes. Type in the city, and voila! You get the area code.

---

## Features 🌟

- **Terminal-based Interaction**: Run the app straight from your terminal.
- **City-Area Code Lookup**: Pre-loaded with ten cities and their area codes.
- **Error Handling**: If you enter a city not in the database, the app lets you know and gives you another try.

---

## Dependencies 🛠

- Ruby version 2.7.4

```bash
# If Ruby's not yet on your system, use these commands
brew update
brew install ruby
```
